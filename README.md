# Ubisoft-Rabbids-Coding-Design-Level-Challenge-2021

This is my submission for the Ubisoft Rubbids Coding Design Level Challenge 2021. This challenge is in collaboration with Libraries Without Borders, an international non-profit organization that strengthens the capacity of people in vulnerable situations by facilitating access to education, culture, and information.

Rabbids Coding is a game created to be a fun and engaging educational experience, giving people the tools to get excited about learning programming basis.

Our challenge was to create the next level of the Rabbids Coding Game. This was made possible with the help of the Rabbids Coding Level Editor provided along with a basic tutorial video.
